The 2024 Major League Baseball season (MLB) began on March 20–21 with a two-game series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres held in Seoul, South Korea, before the regular season proper ran from March 28 to September 30.[1][2] The 94th All-Star Game was played on July 16 at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas,[3] with the American League winning, 5–3.[4] The postseason then began on October 1 and concluded with Game 5 of the World Series on October 30.[5] Going into the season, the defending World Series champions were the Texas Rangers from the 2023 season. During the offseason, the Oakland Athletics were approved by MLB owners to relocate to Las Vegas in 2028.[6][7] It was also the team's final season in Oakland as they left the Oakland Coliseum to temporarily play at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento for three years.[8]

Only two teams were unable to complete the entire 162-game regular season schedule, as the game between the Houston Astros and the Cleveland Guardians at Progressive Field on September 29 was scrapped due to rain and never made up, owing to scheduling constraints and the game being inconsequential to the playoffs. It would be the first time since 2021 that a few teams played more regular season games than the others.[9] This cancellation led to a scenario where had the Astros and Mets both won their respective pennants, the Mets would have home field advantage by a half game. Since the Astros held the superior head to head record, this means that the cancellation could have potentially decided home field advantage in the World Series (as if the game was played and the Astros won, the Astros would have held the advantage). However, neither team would make the title series, making the potential moot.

It was also the first season since 2014 that no team won at least 100 games (not counting the shortened 2020 season).[10][11]

With their finish of 41–121, the Chicago White Sox achieved the record for most losses in the Modern Era (since 1901), surpassing the New York Mets of 1962.[12]

Schedule
On July 13, 2023, Major League Baseball released its 2024 schedule. There were 162 games scheduled for all teams. As has been the case since 2023, each team was scheduled to play 13 games against their division rivals, totaling 52 games. Each team would play six games against six opponents and seven games against four opponents in the same league for a total of 64 games. Each team would also play 46 interleague games, including a four-game home-and-home series against their designated interleague rival.[13][1]

As part of the MLB World Tour, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres opened the season at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul on March 20–21, in the first-ever MLB regular season games played in South Korea. Opening Day in North America occurred on March 28, with all but four clubs in action with the Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, and Philadelphia Phillies opening on March 29 because of a postponement due to inclement weather.[14][15] Other MLB World Tour series include the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies at Estadio Alfredo Harp Helú in Mexico City on April 27–28,[16] the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies at London Stadium in London on June 8–9,[13][1] and the Boston Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays in spring training at Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo on March 9–10.

The San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals played at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama on June 20, in a game honoring the Negro leagues and Hall of Fame outfielder Willie Mays, who was supposed to attend the game, but passed away two days before. The 94th All-Star Game was played on July 16, hosted by the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, with the American League prevailing, 5–3. The MLB Little League Classic at Bowman Field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania was played on August 18 with the New York Yankees taking on the Detroit Tigers.[13][1]

Rule changes
On December 21, 2023, MLB announced a set of rule changes to take effect in 2024.[17]

Following a dead ball, the pitch clock will restart as soon as the pitcher receives a new ball from the umpire (previously the clock restarted once the pitcher entered the circle around the pitcher's mound).
When runners are on base, the pitch clock's starting time will decrease from 20 seconds to 18 seconds.
Visits to the mound will be reduced from five to four per game. Teams will receive an extra mound visit in the ninth inning if they have used four prior to that point (or in the case of a called game the final inning by the losing team).
The runner's lane will be widened to the cut of the infield grass in fair territory. The distance between the foul line and the infield grass will be between 18 and 24 inches in all ballparks, with a grace period for non-compliant parks to make modifications. The runner's actions are deemed legal if running in fair territory provided both feet are on or touching the dirt.
A pitcher who warms up at the start of an inning must face at least one batter; he may not be replaced during or after warmups unless injured.
Spring training
Spring training for the 2024 season began in late February and lasted through most of March. Teams began workouts and practice for spring training beginning in mid-February. Pitchers and catchers reported first, followed by position players a few days later.[18]

Prior to the start of the regular season, each team played between 27 and 34 spring training games (with the exception of the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers, who played a shortened spring training of 21 and 22 games respectively, due to their regular season games in Seoul), beginning on February 22. There were several times during spring training when a team had two different squads playing different teams simultaneously. In addition to spring training games, teams occasionally played exhibition games with non-MLB teams, such as Minor League Baseball teams, independent teams, or college teams. These exhibition games are not counted in spring training standings. Spring training ended on March 26, two days before the Opening Day.

During spring training in 2024, MLB launched a new initiative called MLB Spring Breakout. Each organization puts together a team of their best prospects to compete against another organization's prospects from March 14 to March 17.[19]

Uniforms

Wholesale changes
Nike's new Vapor Premier template started being used across all Major League uniforms in 2024, replacing the previous Majestic Athletic FlexBase template that Nike inherited upon taking over MLB's uniform contract in 2020. The new template was first used in the uniforms worn during the 2023 All-Star Game.[145] The Nike Vapor Premier uniforms, manufactured by Fanatics, have received criticism from players and fans for its subpar quality compared to previous uniforms.[146][147] During spring training, the Royals opted out of using the Vapor Premier template, instead wearing unifoms that feature the larger player name and number font used by the older uniforms.[148] In late April 2024, the MLB Players Association sent a memo to players stating that the uniforms would be overhauled, at the latest by the start of the 2025 season, hoping to rectify many of the complaints aimed at Nike's Vapor Premier template. The MLBPA "placed the blame on Nike" and the Vapor Premier uniform, claiming "Nike was innovating something that didn't need to be innovated", while "absolv[ing] Fanatics".[149]
The Diamondbacks unveiled a new uniform set, adding teal as a full-time accent color. Cream returned as the base color on the home uniforms for the first time since 2006, as is the alternate "D-snake" logo. Sand was removed entirely from the uniforms, except for the "City Connect" uniform.[150]
Due to Nike's 4+1 Rule, the Phillies dropped their red alternate uniform in favor of a City Connect uniform to be unveiled during the 2024 season. It had been used in the regular season for home games in 2016 and 2017, and again from 2021 to 2023 for road games.[151]
The Mets removed the white outline on the text and logo on their black alternate jerseys and caps.[152]
The Yankees made slight changes to their road uniform by removing the white outline on the lettering and numbering as well as the stripe pattern on their sleeves. It was the first time since 1972 that the team had changed their road uniforms.[153]
The Nationals added a pullover alternate uniform and changed their road uniforms. It was the first time since the Cincinnati Reds uniforms from 1972–1992 to have a pullover jersey on a regular basis. The team also retired their red alternate uniform with a white curly "W".[154] The team also removed the front numbers to their home and alternate navy jerseys.[155]
The Marlins modified their black alternate uniforms by featuring white accents to the team's name on the front and the player's name and number on the back. The team also introduced and modified their teal alternate uniforms by featuring the team's name as well.[156]
The Braves added a red lining to their alternate navy jerseys.[157]

City Connect
Main article: City Connect
Eight teams unveiled new City Connect uniforms and wore them for the first time during the season. Additionally, the Los Angeles Dodgers unveiled their City Connect this year, becoming the first team to change their City Connect uniform since the program's inception.[145]

The Phillies' City Connect uniform features blue and yellow colors across the uniform, inspired by the Flag of Philadelphia. The jersey features Philadelphia's common abbreviation "PHILLY" across the chest in white lettering. The cap features the Liberty Bell, with the skyline of Philadelphia inside and two stars on each side.[166]
The Mets' City Connect uniform features several elements that are related to New York City. The jersey features purple pinstripes and New York's abbreviation "NYC" across the chest. The cap features the Mets' "NY" interlocked logo along with the Queensboro Bridge, which connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens. The purple color was inspired by the 7 subway line that runs to Citi Field.[167]
The Rays' City Connect uniform features the city name outlined in neon across the chest, similar to the Devil Rays road jersey from 1998 to 2000. The cap features the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which crosses into St. Petersburg along with the sting-ray, also called "skyray". Another logo features three palm trees and a pelican, both of which have several ties to the area, symbolizing the "Bro Bowl" skate park and the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the Florida State Negro League in the 1940s and 50's.
The Tigers' City Connect uniform features elements that pay tribute to the automotive industry in Detroit. The jersey features blue and black gradient coloring and Detroit's nickname "Motor City" across the chest in white lettering. The cap is also black and features the city name across and in white lettering.
The Guardians' City Connect uniform features elements that pay tribute to the Guardians of Traffic. The jersey features Cleveland's abbreviation "CLE" in white art-deco lettering inside of a dark blue base. It also features a red and white stripe pattern around the uniform which pays tribute to Cleveland's past uniforms in the 1990s. The cap features a dark blue diamond shape "C" along with white and dark blue colors.
The Cardinals' City Connect uniform features the nickname of St. Louis, "The Lou" across the chest of the jersey and featuring the "birds on the bat" logo. The cap is red and features the abbreviation in St. Louis "STL" across and in white lettering. The font for the abbreviation is from their 1920 uniforms.
The Blue Jays' City Connect uniforms feature several elements that are inspired by Toronto's nightlife. The jersey features the city name and the skyline of Toronto in red and blue colors. The cap features a "split T" logo in red and blue and a maple leaf, which is inspired from the Flag of Toronto.
The Twins' City Connect uniforms feature several elements that are inspired by the 10,000 Lakes that are located in Minnesota. The Jersey has a look of a rippling effect, with the abbreviation MN on the right of the Jersey, with the North Star between the two letters on top. The Jersey is mainly a light blue/blue mix with yellow outlines on the sleeves and a yellow belt. The hat has the outline of the state of Minnesota with a lake on the bottom of the state and the northern lights on the top, and a North Star where the Twins are located, which is in the Twin Cities area (Minneapolis). On the side of the hat is a wordmark that reads 10,000 Lakes. On the bottom of the hat bill is the outline of Lake Minnetonka.[168]
The Dodgers' second City Connect uniform features elements inspired by the nicknames of Los Angeles, "City of Dreams" and the "City of Stars". The jersey features the city name in dusk and electric blue lettering. The sleeve features the "LA" interlocked along with the Dodgers scripted "D" combined in dusk blue. The cap is dusk blue and features combined "LA" interlocked and the Dodgers scripted "D" in cream lettering.[169]
Prior to the season, it was announced that 2024 would be the final season the Nationals would wear their "cherry blossom" City Connect uniforms.[170] Late in the season, the Giants, Rockies, Marlins, and Astros each announced that they would be retiring their respective City Connect uniforms in favor of new designs for the 2025 season.[171][172][173]

Broadcast rights
Television
National
This was the third year of the existing seven-year deals with ESPN, Fox, TBS, Apple TV+, and MLB Network.[185] This was the first year of a multi-year deal with TelevisaUnivision.[186]

Linear television
Fox continued to air their Baseball Night in America and Fox Saturday Baseball slate of exclusive games on Saturday and select Thursday nights. The network aired the game at Rickwood Field, and also aired the 2024 MLB All-Star Game; both being exclusive games.[187] FS1 also broadcasts non-exclusive games, including a game on most Saturday afternoons.[188] Following his retirement, Adam Wainwright joined Fox as a full-time color commentator. He previously had done color commentary for Fox during select playoff games.[189]
TBS continued to broadcast MLB Tuesday. Most games were blacked out in the home markets of the teams playing, however, TBS was allowed to co-exist once with a team's local broadcast.[190] During the final month of the regular season, TBS' sister network TruTV also aired MLB Race to the Pennant on Tuesday nights. The show featured a whip-around format hosted by Alanna Rizzo and Yonder Alonso. For the first time, TruTV also aired a regular season baseball game, between the Astros and the Padres, on Tuesday, September 17.[191]
ESPN continued to broadcast Sunday Night Baseball, with the option to show alternate broadcasts. ESPN also exclusively aired six other non-Sunday night games, including a primetime game on opening night, two Wednesday Night Baseball games, one game from the MLB Mexico City Series and one game from the MLB London Series.
